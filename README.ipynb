    "**openMP** is a library that offers support for seamless parallelization through thread launching. As the programmer, you only need to identify parts of your code feeble for parallelization, while the library itself is an abstractions that helps with loop indexing, thread launching, built-in locks, and is portable on different os, making it a nice option for users who don't care about hardware optimations for every different machine. \n",

If want to run yourself, make sure you follow the Software guidelines and pull all 4 branches."
