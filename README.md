# Requirements

## Hardware
- Tested on debian-like machine (pop-os to be exact), but ubuntu probably works

## Software
- Tested with g++ --version=10.3.0
```
sudo apt-get install g++ // or
sudo apt-get build-essential
```
-  Install **openMP**
```
sudo apt-get install libomp-dev
```
**openMP** is a library that offers support for seamless parallelization through thread launching. As the programmer, you only need to identify parts of your code feeble for parallelization, while the library itself is an abstractions that helps with loop indexing, thread launching, built-in locks, and is portable on different os, making it a nice option for users who don't care about hardware optimations for every different machine. 


# Description

Follow this [youtube link from Geometry Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDGpsfwAaqo&t=705s&ab_channel=GeometryLab) for a more detailed explanation of a skiplist. Here is a summary of the properties of skiplist.

| Insertion | Deletion | Search |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| log(n)    | log(n)   | log(n) |

\*expected time

The skiplist is able to achieve these marks because it uses layers/levels of linked list (visually) stacked on top of each other for *skipping* sections of a normal linked list (which has linear time search), and thus tries to emulate the methodology behind *binary search*.
